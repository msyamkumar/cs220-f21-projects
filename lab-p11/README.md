# Lab P11: Scatter Plots, Recursion, and Default Dictionaries

In this lab, you'll learn how to create scatter plots, practice
writing recursive code, and learn techniques about default dictionaries.  
Start by creating a
notebook for this lab.



## Scatter

We'll eventually learn much more about scatter plots, but for now,
just copy/paste these two cells to your notebook:

**Cell 1:**

```python
%matplotlib inline
```

**Cell 2:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def scatter(x, y, xlabel="please label me!", ylabel="please label me!"):
    df = pd.DataFrame({"x":x, "y":y})
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x="x", y="y", color="black", fontsize=16, xlim=0, ylim=0)
    ax.set_xlabel(xlabel, fontsize=16)
    ax.set_ylabel(ylabel, fontsize=16)
    ax.get_xaxis().get_major_formatter().set_scientific(False)
    ax.get_yaxis().get_major_formatter().set_scientific(False)
```

Let's try it (paste/run the following):

```python
scatter([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],
        [4.1, 4.3, 4.2, 5.8, 6.0, 6.4, 8.4, 8.0, 7.9, 8.3, 8.1, 8.2, 1.9, 2.1, 1.0])
```

We need some axis labels; try setting them:  

```python
scatter([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0],
        [4.1, 4.3, 4.2, 5.8, 6.0, 6.4, 8.4, 8.0, 7.9, 8.3, 8.1, 8.2, 1.9, 2.1, 1.0],
        xlabel="ice cream scoops eaten", ylabel="happiness (out of 10)")
```


Your scatter plot should look like the following:

<img src="images/test1.png" width="400">


Now let's try to plot 2 dictionaries:
```python
dict_x_axis = {"Point1": 0.0, "Point2": 5.0, "Point3": 1.0, "Point4": 8.0, "Point5": 6.0}
dict_y_axis = {"Point1": 6.8, "Point2": 2.0, "Point3": 4.4, "Point4": 1.3, "Point5": 0.7}

scatter(dict_x_axis, dict_y_axis, xlabel="ice cream scoops eaten", ylabel="happiness (out of 10)")

```
Your scatter plot should look like the following:

<img src="images/test2.png" width="400">


## Recursion

As we learned in class, a function is recursive when it calls itself,
directly or indirectly.  We'll give you some practice here to complete
some recursive code.

### Problem 1: Factorial

Yes, we did this in class, but see if you can complete it from memory
(or by deducing the answer) before referring back to your notes:

```python
def fact(n):
    if ????:
        return 1
    return n * ????
```

Here's a hint (the following is math, not Python):

```
1! = 1
2! = 1 * 2 = 2
3! = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
```

When you're done, test your code with a few different inputs.  To
better understand what's happening, here are a couple things you could
do:
* Run your code in Python Tutor.
* Add a print to the beginning of your function, like this: `print("fact(" + str(n) + ") was called")`.


### Problem 2: String Reversal

We want `reverse` to reverse the letters in a string.  So, for
example, `reverse("COVID")` should return "DIVOC".

```python
def reverse(s):
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return ????
    return reverse(????) + ????
```

Hints:
* Use indexing and slicing on s.
* Notice that "ABCD" reversed is "BCD" reversed (i.e., "DCB"), concatenated with "A".

Try your function with a few strings.



### Problem 3: List Reversal

Write a function that reverses a list.  So, for example,
`list_rev([1,2,3])` should return `[3,2,1]`.  Both lists and strings
are sequences, so the code should be very similar to your string
reversal function.  In fact, we recommend you start by copying that
code, calling it with a list, then identifying the one reason the your
previous function doesn't work for lists as well as strings.

Hint:
* `[1,2,3]+4` is invalid, but `[1,2,3]+[4]` performs list concatenation.


### Problem 4: Dictionary Printer

Complete the following function so that it prints nested dictionaries
in an easy-to-read way:

```python
def dprint(d, indent=0):
    print("Dictionary:")
    for k in d:
        v = d[????]
        print(" " * indent, end="")
        print(k + " => ", end="")
        if type(????) == dict:
            dprint(v, ????)
        else:
            print(v)
```

A call to `dprint({"A": 1, "B": {"C": 2, "D": 3, "E": {"F": 4}}, "G": 5})` should print the following:

```
Dictionary:
A => 1
B => Dictionary:
  C => 2
  D => 3
  E => Dictionary:
    F => 4
G => 5
```


## Default Dictionaries

Try running this:

```python
fruit_counts = {}
fruit_counts["apple"] = 10    # line 1: works
print(fruit_counts["apple"])  # line 2: works
print(fruit_counts["banana"]) # line 3: fails
```

Notice that when inserting values, we can use new keys (line 1), and
they are automatically added for us.  But when looking up values, it
fails if the key hasn't been seen before (line 3).

There's an alternative to `dict` called `defaultdict` that can provide
a default value instead of failing in situations such as line 3 above.

Let's try it:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

fruit_counts = defaultdict(int)
fruit_counts["apple"] = 10    # line 1: works
print(fruit_counts["apple"])  # line 2: works
print(fruit_counts["banana"]) # line 3: works
```

Notice two things:

* We need to import defaultdict before we can use it.
* When we create the defaultdict object, we need to tell it what type of things it should contain so that it can provide reasonable defaults (e.g., 0 for int).

Lists are also interesting default values.  Consider these two examples:

**With regular dictionary:**

```python
rows = [
     ("alice", 5),
     ("bob", 6),
     ("alice", 7),
     ("bob", 8),
]

scores = dict()
for row in rows:
    if not row[0] in scores:
        scores[row[0]] = [row[1]]
    else:
        scores[row[0]].append(row[1])

scores
```

**With default dictionary:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict

rows = [
     ("alice", 5),
     ("bob", 6),
     ("alice", 7),
     ("bob", 8),
]

scores = defaultdict(list)
for row in rows:
    scores[row[0]].append(row[1]) # creates a new list if necessary

dict(scores)
```

Try completing the following to count letter frequencies:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

letter_counts = defaultdict(????)

for letter in "banana":
    letter_counts[????] += ????

dict(letter_counts)
```

Good luck on p11! We encourage you to stay in lab and ask the TA and Peer Mentor questions.
